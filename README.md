In this project I created a web page called 'music player' where the user can log in and listen to music, selecting from a list and choosing his
favorite songs. The user logs in with a user name and a password. There are also admin accounts. 
I worked in Intelij IDEA, I used JSPs to create the web page and Postgre SQL to create the database.
